leakcheck-msgq module is an utility to invoke LSAN leak check API for any component that is built 
with gcc-sanitizers for runtime heap leak detection (LSAN)

leakcheck-msgq Package contains 2 parts:
1. Runtime library (libmsgq.so.0.0.0) that is linked with component being debugged for 
heap leak detection. It creates a POSIX message queue "/mq_leak_<pid>" and waits for message to call
lsan leak check API.
2. Common utility (leakCheck_utility) that can be used to call lsan API for any process that has
linkage to the runtime library.


NOTE: Utility shall be enhanced for receiving other types of messages
